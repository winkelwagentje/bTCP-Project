FAILING TESTS:
22, 70, 80, 90, 91
NOTE: 22 works passes the test about 70% of the time or so.
IMPORTANT OBSERVATION: the max tries shouldnt be too higg; otherwise the test will fail.
This is because the test will time out quite fast. When the max tries is about 10, it will
perform fine. (Still not perfect though; it still fails at times.)
